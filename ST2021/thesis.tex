\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

The climatology of Princeton is one that belongs to the mid-latitudes,
which is characterized by having four seasons that results in a large
variation in temperature throughout a year. In terms of the average
calculated between 1981 and 2010, Princeton gets an average of 1227~mm
of precipitation annually, and the precipitation distribution
throughout the year is fairly even, with less precipitation in the
winter~\cite[]{PRISM}.  According to the Koppen-Geiger Climate
Classification, Princeton, NJ lies in the classification Cfa, which
denotes a temperate climate, with no dry season, and hot summers
defined as reaching~22$^\circ$C or higher \cite[]{Peel2008}. Princeton
having no dry season means that precipitation is well spread out
throughout the year.

Our weather station on the top of Guyot Hall is Vaisala weather
transmitter WXT530 series. It measures six weather parameters of air
pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and wind
direction. The rainfall is measured using an acoustic Vaisala RAINCAP
Sensor, which helps avoid the complications of flooding, wetting, and
evaporation losses \cite[]{Vaisala}. By analyzing the precipitation
bwteen 2017 and today, I first summarize the data using this
climatology, in terms of exponential distributions and their
parameters, by season and by year, before attepting to predict
precipitation events based on other variables that are observed by the weather station.

These following histograms show the distribution of precipitation event duration in terms of minutes and shows the different duration distributions per season.

\section{Methods \label{sec:methods}}

I shall define the following terms. The time series of
\textbf{precipitation} as recorded by the instrument is denoted $e_i$,
where $i$ indexes the measurement intervals, each 60~s long. I define
a precipitation \textbf{event} $E_j^\tau $ as a sequence of
\textbf{duration} $d_j\ge \tau$ containing contiguous nonzero
precipitation measurements $e_i>0$, flanked left and right by zeros,
$e_i=0$, and where $\tau$ is in minutes.

Furthermore, I define a precipitation \textbf{non-event} $N_j^\tau$,
  as having a contiguous set of zeros, $e_i=0$, whose combined duration
  exceeds $\tau$, flanked left and right by non-zero values, $e_i=0$.

One more term to define is \textbf{precipitation intensity}, which for
a precipitation event $E_j^\tau$ is the total amount of precipitation
divided by its duration, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
I_j^\tau = \fracd{\sum_i e_i }{d_j} ,
\quad
\mbox{for}\,\,\,\, i\,\,\,\, \mbox{belonging to the event}\,\,\,\, E_j^\tau
.
\end{equation}



For further analysis, I breaking down the year into seasons, as
different seasons may have different characteristics with regards to
precipitation. I will define the seasons as follows: Winter will be
December, January, and February. ``Winter'' of a certain year contains
December of the previous year.  Spring will be March, April, and
May. Summer is June, July, and August. Fall is September, October,
November.

Once we have characterized the climatology of precipitation, we will start moving towards buidling predictive models for precipitation. In order to see how accurate such models are in comparison to observed precipitation. Such accuracy we shall use is to see whether the model and the observed data match in terms of whether there exists precipitation at a given minute. We ignore the non-precipitation when looking at accuracy because by matching non-precipitation minutes in both the model and the observed data, we end up getting an accuracy of over 90\%, which not useful. So, if the model and the observed data do not match in terms whether there exists precipitation, this contributes to the model being deemed less accurate. We can have a stricter definition of accuracy, in which we set up the precipitation condition, in addition to saying that the intensity must match too, otherwise we can not say the model and observed data match. This stricter definition of model accuracy might be used when thinking about 


Figure~\ref{p2019} shows the distribution of durations of 3198
precipitation events $E_j^1$, i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=1$~min for
the year 2019, broken down by season. In order to make bins that contain non-zero values, I created bins using duration percentiles. I used unique values obtained from using a range of percentiles from 0 to 100, in 2 and 5 percent intervals. For one analysis, I stopped at 98 \% believing this would be the best approach in terms of fitting. At the same time, I also made sure to analyze the data including the 100 percentile, to see how it differs when including the extremes. Such purpose is also to realize that excluding such extremes produced modelled precipitation that did not last long as well as well as the gaps between precipitation events being too small.  

I used an exponential fit to the
frequency-duration histograms for all 1253 events $E_j^2$,
i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=2$~min. For all the other years, as shown
in Figures~\ref{p2020}, \ref{p2018} and~\ref{p2017}, I used a similar
procedure.

Excluding the first interval shown, focusing on events of duration
greater than or equal to 2~min, we propose an exponential model for
the histogram, with the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{expod}
  F = \beta \,e^{\alpha d},
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the frequency and $d$ the duration, and with $\beta$ the
unitless frequency coefficient and $\alpha$ is the exponential
coefficient (in units of min$^{-1}$). Table~\ref{firsttable} shows the
coefficients~$\beta$ and the exponential coefficients~$\alpha$ from
looking at the yearly frequency of precipitation duration.

We shall also propose the following equations which will also describe an exponential model for the histogram regarding non-precipitation events, which is described by the following equation: 
\begin{equation}\label{expod_np}
	F_{np} = \gamma \,e^{\delta D},
\end{equation}
where $F_{np}$ is the frequency of non-precipitation events, $D$ being duration, and $\gamma $ being the unitless frequency coefficient and $\delta $ is the exponential coefficient. Table~\ref{thirdtable_98} shows the coefficients~$\gamma$ and exponential coefficients~$\delta$ from looking at yearly frequency of non-precipitation event durations. 

Another similar equation for precipitation intensity can be described by the following equation: 
\begin{equation}\label{expod_inten}
	F_{inten} = \epsilon \,e^{\zeta I},
\end{equation}
where $F_{inten}$ is the frequency of intensity of precipitation events, $I$ is the intensity of the precipitation events, $\epsilon$ is the unitless frequency coefficient, and $\zeta$ is the exponential coefficient. Table~\ref{fourthtable} shows the coefficients~$\epsilon$ and the exponential coefficients~$\zeta$ from looking at yearly frequency of intensity of precipitation events.

\input{firsttable}

\input{firsttable_100}
Based on Table~\ref{firsttable}, the $\beta$ values are similar to
each other with the exception of 2017, which only had partial data
starting in the Summer. Even, with the partial data we have from 2017
and 2020, it is clear that the $\alpha$ values are similar to each
other. Focusing on the years with complete data, 2018 and 2019, it is
clear that yearly variations exists between them. All $\alpha$ values
are negative.

In the seasonal variations, we see that Summer has $\alpha$ values
that are less negative compared to the other seasons as well as having
a lower $\beta$ compared to the other seasons. However looking at
Table~\ref{secondtable}, we see that the summers also have a lot of
precipitation. The fewer amounts of precipitation events in the
Summer, but with a lot of precipitation gives a higher intensity for
the Summer. For the Winter, the $\alpha$ are the furthest from 0 and
the $\beta$ are large. However, Winter tends to have the lowest values
for total precipitation and the combination of lots of preciptation
events and low precipitation totals results in the lowest intensities
among the four seasons.

The Spring appears to mimic the Winter in that there are a lot of
preciptiation events, but also shares the quality of Summer in having
fairly high precipitation totals. The Fall shares the Summer quality
of having relatively few preciptation events, but tends to have
smaller precipitation totals, so its intensity is less than the
Summer, but greater than the winter precipitation intensity.
\input{secondtable} 

Looking at trying to extend the exponential fit towards non-precipitation event durations, the exponentials for such duration, $\delta$ is less negative overall compared to the exponentials from the precipitation event duration, $\alpha$. Some of this is explained from the fact that the duration of non-precipitation events range from 1 minute to over 2000 minutes, whereas the duration of precipitation events range from 1 minute to just over 300 minutes. At the same time how we bin the durations for both precipitation and non-precipitation events will affect how we get the fits. 






\input{thirdtable.tex}
\input{thirdtable_100.tex}
\input{fourthtable.tex}
\input{fourthtable_100.tex}

In contrast, Table~\ref{fourthtable} for intensity of precipitation events show a more negative exponential compared to either precipitation or non-precipitation event durations. This is partially due to the fact that there are less bins in the intensity of preciptiation events as seen that the vast majority of precipitation events are not particularly intense on average.

Running the model one hundred times let us look at what the average precipitation total the model yields, it yields 195 mm compared to the Summer 2018 total of 268 mm that we used. Furthermore, the accuracy of model precipitation matching model precipitation is only 6$\%$. Looking at \ref{crudemodel}, we see that the model precipitation total is lower than the actual precipitation observed in the Summer of 2018. Furthermore, the precipitation seem to be more frequent compared to the observed 2018 Summer data.
