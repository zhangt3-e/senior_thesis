\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}
The Climatology of Princeton is clearly one that belongs to the mid-latitudes, which is characterized by having four seasons that results in having a large variation in temperature throughout a year. In terms of the average calculated between 1981 and 2010, Princeton gets an average of 48.27 inches (1227 mm) of precipitation annually, and the precipitation distribution throughout the year is fairly even, with less precipitation in the winter (PRISM Project).  According to the Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification, Princeton, NJ lies in the classification Cfa, which denotes a temperate climate, with no dry season, and hot summers defined as reaching 22 degrees Celsius or higher \cite{Peel2008}. Princeton having no dry season means that precipitation should be well spread throughout the year. The weather station that I am getting my data from is a Vaisala weather transmitter WXT530 series. It measures the six weather parameters of air pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed ,and wind direction. The rainfall is measured using an acoustic Vaisala RAINCAP Sensor, which helps avoid the complications of flooding, wetting, and evaporation losses \cite{Vaisala}. One of the good aspects in using machine learning for weather forecasting over numerical weather models is that machine learning costs much less computationally, which allows outperforms many non-numerical weather models \cite{Scher}.

\section{Methods \label{sec:methods}}

I shall define the following terms. The time series of
\textbf{precipitation} as recorded by the instrument is denoted $e_i$,
where $i$ indexes the measurement intervals, each 60~s long. I define
a precipitation \textbf{event} $E_j^\tau $ as a sequence of
\textbf{duration} $d_j>\tau$ containing contiguous nonzero
precipitation measurements $e_i>0$, flanked left and right by zeros,
$e_i=0$, and where $\tau$ is in minutes.

Furthermore, I define a precipitation \textbf{non-event} $N_j^\tau$,
  as having a contiguous set of zeros, $e_i=0$, whose combined duration
  exceeds $\tau$, flanked left and right by non-zero values, $e_i=0$.

One more term to define is \textbf{precipitation intensity}, which for
a precipitation event $E_j^\tau$ is the total amount of precipitation
divided by its duration, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
I_j^\tau = \fracd{\sum_i e_i }{d_j} ,
\quad
\mbox{for}\,\,\,\, i\,\,\,\, \mbox{belonging to the event}\,\,\,\, E_j^\tau
.
\end{equation}


For further analysis, breaking the year down into seasons since
different seasons will have different characteristics with regards to
precipitation. I will define the seasons as follows: Winter will be
December, January, and February. ``Winter'' of a certain year contains
December of the previous year.  Spring will be March, April, and
May. Summer is June, July, and August. Fall is September, October,
November.

Figure~\ref{p2019} shows the distribution of durations of XXXX
precipitation events $E_j^1$, i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=1$~min for
the year 2019, broken down by season. I quote an exponential fit to
the frequency-duration histograms for all YYYY events $E_j^2$,
i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=2$~min.

    Distribution of precipitation duration in 2019, with a breakdown
    by seasons. The minimum duration, $\tau=1$~min, and the maximum
    duration over the data set is 368 min, but the horizontal axis was limited to the 98th percentile of the durations, 42~min, for
    clarity. Superposed is a least-squares fit of a line in log-log
    space of duration versus frequency for the entire year, excluding
    the 1--2~min bin, quoted as the equivalent exponential in this
    space.}

Excluding the first interval, which covers the bare minimum precipitation duration necessary, we have an exponential curve fitting the histogram with the following equation: 
\begin{equation}
	y = \beta e^{\alpha x} 
\end{equation}
	Where $\beta$ is the frequency coefficient and $\alpha $ is the exponential coefficient. 
	
Is the exponential different for W/S/S/F? Can you tell the difference?
Is the exponential different for different years? Can you tell the difference?
And what summarizes it all. \\
The following table shows the coefficients and the exponential coefficients from the looking at the yearly frequency of precipitation duration. \\
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l*{3}{c}r}
		\centering
		Year      & $\beta $ & $\alpha$  \\
		\hline
		2017      & 169.1           & -0.61    \\
		2018      & 391.6           & -0.59    \\
		2019      & 307.8           & -0.54   \\
		2020      & 407.8           & -0.65    \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Based on this table, the $\beta$ values are similar to each other with the exception of 2017, which only had partial data starting from the summer. Even, with the partial data we have from 2017 and 2020, it is clear that the $\alpha$ values are similar to each other. Focusing on the years with complete data, 2018 and 2019, it is clear that yearly variations exists between them.
