\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}
The Climatology of Princeton is clearly one that belongs to the mid-latitudes, which is characterized by having four seasons that results in having a large variation in temperature throughout a year. In terms of the average calculated between 1981 and 2010, Princeton gets an average of 48.27 inches (1227 mm) of precipitation annually, and the precipitation distribution throughout the year is fairly even, with less precipitation in the winter (PRISM Project).  According to the Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification, Princeton, NJ lies in the classification Cfa, which denotes a temperate climate, with no dry season, and hot summers defined as reaching 22 $^\circ C $ or higher \cite{Peel2008}. Princeton having no dry season means that precipitation should be well spread throughout the year.

 The weather station that I am getting my data from is a Vaisala weather transmitter WXT530 series. It measures the six weather parameters of air pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed ,and wind direction. The rainfall is measured using an acoustic Vaisala RAINCAP Sensor, which helps avoid the complications of flooding, wetting, and evaporation losses \cite{Vaisala}. By analyzing the precipitation that is measured from Professor Simons' Vaisala weather station on the top of Guyot Hall from 2017 to present day, I can first summarize the data that is being characterized, then start using this climatology to start predicting precipitation events based on other variables that are observed in the weather station. 
\section{Methods \label{sec:methods}}

I shall define the following terms. The time series of
\textbf{precipitation} as recorded by the instrument is denoted $e_i$,
where $i$ indexes the measurement intervals, each 60~s long. I define
a precipitation \textbf{event} $E_j^\tau $ as a sequence of
\textbf{duration} $d_j\ge \tau$ containing contiguous nonzero
precipitation measurements $e_i>0$, flanked left and right by zeros,
$e_i=0$, and where $\tau$ is in minutes.

Furthermore, I define a precipitation \textbf{non-event} $N_j^\tau$,
  as having a contiguous set of zeros, $e_i=0$, whose combined duration
  exceeds $\tau$, flanked left and right by non-zero values, $e_i=0$.

One more term to define is \textbf{precipitation intensity}, which for
a precipitation event $E_j^\tau$ is the total amount of precipitation
divided by its duration, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
I_j^\tau = \fracd{\sum_i e_i }{d_j} ,
\quad
\mbox{for}\,\,\,\, i\,\,\,\, \mbox{belonging to the event}\,\,\,\, E_j^\tau
.
\end{equation}


For further analysis, breaking the year down into seasons since
different seasons will have different characteristics with regards to
precipitation. I will define the seasons as follows: Winter will be
December, January, and February. ``Winter'' of a certain year contains
December of the previous year.  Spring will be March, April, and
May. Summer is June, July, and August. Fall is September, October,
November.

Figure~\ref{p2019} shows the distribution of durations of 3198
precipitation events $E_j^1$, i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=1$~min for
the year 2019, broken down by season. I used an exponential fit to
the frequency-duration histograms for all 1253 events $E_j^2$,
i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=2$~min. For all the other years, I have 
used similar procedure in which the distribution of the duration of 
precipitation events for events $E_j^1$ are graphed and an exponential 
fit is used for events $E_j^2$ and correspondingly graphed.

Excluding the first interval shown, focusing on events of duration
greater than or equal to 2 min, we propose an exponential model for
the histogram, with the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	F = \beta e^{\alpha d},
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the frequency and $d$ the duration, and with $\beta$ the
unitless frequency coefficient and $\alpha$ is the exponential
coefficient (in units of 1/min).
Table 1 shows
the coefficients and the exponential coefficients from the looking at
the yearly frequency of precipitation duration. 
\\ Based on this table, the $\beta$ values are similar to each other with
the exception of 2017, which only had partial data starting from the
summer. Even, with the partial data we have from 2017 and 2020, it is
clear that the $\alpha$ values are similar to each other. Focusing on
the years with complete data, 2018 and 2019, it is clear that yearly
variations exists between them. In the seasonal variations, we see that the Summer has $\alpha $ that are closer to 0 compared to the other seasons.
