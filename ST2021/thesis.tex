\section{Methods \label{sec:methods}}

I shall define the following terms. The time series of
\textbf{precipitation} as recorded by the instrument is denoted $e_i$,
where $i$ indexes the measurement intervals, each 60~s long. I define
a precipitation \textbf{event} $E_j^\tau $ as a sequence of
\textbf{duration} $d_j>\tau$ containing contiguous nonzero
precipitation measurements $e_i>0$, flanked left and right by zeros,
$e_i=0$, and where $\tau$ is in minutes.

Furthermore, I define a precipitation \textbf{non-event} $N_j^\tau$,
  as having a contiguous set of zeros, $e_i=0$, whose combined duration
  exceeds $\tau$, flanked left and right by non-zero values, $e_i=0$.

One more term to define is \textbf{precipitation intensity}, which for
a precipitation event $E_j^\tau$ is the total amount of precipitation
divided by its duration, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
I_j^\tau = \fracd{\sum_i e_i }{d_j} ,
\quad
\mbox{for}\,\,\,\, i\,\,\,\, \mbox{belonging to the event}\,\,\,\, E_j^\tau
.
\end{equation}


For further analysis, breaking the year down into seasons since
different seasons will have different characteristics with regards to
precipitation. I will define the seasons as follows: Winter will be
December, January, and February. ``Winter'' of a certain year contains
December of the previous year.  Spring will be March, April, and
May. Summer is June, July, and August. Fall is September, October,
November.

Figure~\ref{p2019} shows the distribution of durations of XXXX
precipitation events $E_j^1$, i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=1$~min for
the year 2019, broken down by season. I quote an exponential fit to
the frequency-duration histograms for all YYYY events $E_j^2$,
i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=2$~min.

    Distribution of precipitation duration in 2019, with a breakdown
    by seasons. The minimum duration, $\tau=1$~min, and the maximum
    duration over the data set is XX~min, but the horizontal axis was
    limited to the 98th percentile of the durations, 42~min, for
    clarity. Superposed is a least-squares fit of a line in log-log
    space of duration versus frequency for the entire year, excluding
    the 1--2~min bin, quoted as the equivalent exponential in this
    space.}

Is the exponential different for W/S/S/F? Can you tell the difference?
Is the exponential different for different years? Can you tell the difference?
And what summarizes it all.
The following table shows the coefficients and the exponential coefficients from the looking at the yearly frequency of precipitation duration. 
\begin{tabular}{l*{3}{c}r}
	Year      & Coefficient & Exponential  \\
	\hline
	2017      & 169.1           & -0.61    \\
	2018      & 391.6           & -0.59    \\
	2019      & 307.8           & -0.54   \\
	2020      & 407.8           & -0.65    \\
