\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The climatology of Princeton is one that belongs to the mid-latitudes, which
is characterized by having four seasons that results in a large variation in
temperature throughout a year. In terms of the average calculated between
1981 and 2010, Princeton gets an average of 1227~mm of precipitation
annually, and the precipitation distribution throughout the year is fairly
even, with less precipitation in the winter~\cite[]{PRISM}.  According to
the Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification, Princeton, NJ lies in the
classification Cfa, which denotes a temperate climate, with no dry season,
and hot summers defined as reaching~22$^\circ$C or higher
\cite[]{Peel2008}. Princeton having no dry season means that precipitation
is well spread out throughout the year.

Our weather station on the top of Guyot Hall is Vaisala weather transmitter
WXT530 series. It measures six weather parameters of air pressure,
temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, and wind direction. The
rainfall is measured using an acoustic Vaisala RAINCAP Sensor, which helps
avoid the complications of flooding, wetting, and evaporation losses
\cite[]{Vaisala}. 

Air temperature is the temperature that the thermometer measures when
exposed to the air, while sheltered from direct solar radiation.
Atmospheric Pressure is measuring the pressure exerted by the atmosphere due
to gravitation attraction on the air column above a point in question
\cite[]{AMS}.  Relative Humidity is the ratio of vapor pressure to saturation
vapor pressure with respect to water \cite{AMS}.  This means that two air
parcels can the same amount of water vapor, but if one air parcel is a
warmer temperature than the other parcel, the higher temperature air parcel
has a lower relative humidity than the lower temperature air parcel, since
warmer air has a higher saturation vapor pressure for water.
%At the same time, relative humidity becomes important especially during
%warmer temperatures, as increases in relative humidity can mean the
%apparent temperature felt by humans will increase. This is the heat index,
%in which
Precipitation accumulation is the amount of water substance that has fallen
at a given point over a specified period of time \cite[]{AMS}.

Shown in Figure~\ref{daily}, data are being recorded every minute and air
pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, and Precipitation accumulation
is being plotted. This day happens to have precipitation, thus we can see
some of the variables that could lead to precipitation actually occuring. It
appears that relative humidity becomes higher before a precipitation event,
and that the air pressure is low, while a precipitation event
occurs. However, this is only one event and many precipitation events will
be

% FJS BASIC CLIMATOLOGY FIGURES TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, RELHUM

From the data that I analyzed, the following is the climatology of Princeton
from 2017 to 2021. Looking at Figure~\ref{Clim1}, we see that we have
temperature and precipitation that varies throughout the year. Temperatures
start increasing before peaking in July, before decreasing until
January. This is consistent with the fact that Princeton has four seasons,
which shows cold winters, warm summers, and mild springs and falls. At the
same time, there is more precipitation in the spring and summer compared to
the relative lack of precipitation in the fall and winter.

The month with the lowest average precipitation appears to be January at an
average monthly precipitation of 44~mm. Whereas, the month with the highest
average precipitation is July with 123~mm.

When looking at Figure~\ref{Temp_range}, we see that the ranges of
temperature are not equal in throughout the months. For example winter
months of January and Feburary have a big range that span from about $20
^\circ $C to $-10 ^\circ$C. Meanwhile we have summer months such as July and
August whose range of temperatures is smaller, from about $30 ^\circ $C to
about $15 ^\circ $C.

We also see that relative humidity for Princeton is higher in the months of
August to October, whereas the lowest relative humidity seems to be in the
months of March and April.  With Figure~\ref{RH_range}, we can see that all
the months have similar upper extremes of about 90\% for relative humidity,
which can indicate precipitation. At the same time, the range for relative
humidity is largest in the Spring time, with March, April, and May seem to
have a range between 15\% to 90\% for relative humidity, with caution that
this is just data from 3 years.

For atmospheric pressure, the lowest monthly air pressure are found in the
months of April and June, while the highest monthly air pressure are found
in the month of Feburary. Though the values for the mean atmospheric
pressure are all pretty close to each other ranging from about 1.00~bar to
1.01~bar. The more interesting aspects of atmospheric pressure comes from
the range of atmospheric pressure, where the months of May to September all
seem to have a small range that vary between 0.995~bar to about
1.02~bar. Meanwhile we have months like October, which have a larger range
of atmospheric pressure, which ranges from 0.97~bar to 1.03~bar. Clearly
these low atmospheric pressure must come from an intense low pressure that
passed near Princeton and it turns out that for the month of October from
2017-2020, we see that the values between 0.97~bar to 0.985~bar represent
the 0 to 1st percentile of all atmospheric pressures for the month of
October, so they are extremely low pressures. Other months such as November
to February have relatively large ranges for atmospheric pressure as well.

\section{Descriptive Climatology of Precipitation}\label{sec:dcp}

Despite the information given to us in looking the ranges of meteorological
variables like temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure,
precipitation events are no where to be seen.  I shall define the following
terms. The time series of \textbf{precipitation} as recorded by the
instrument is denoted $e_i$, where $i$ indexes the measurement intervals,
each 60~s long. I define a precipitation \textbf{event} $E_j^\tau $ as a
sequence of \textbf{duration} $d_j\ge \tau$ containing contiguous nonzero
precipitation measurements $e_i>0$, flanked left and right by zeros,
$e_i=0$, and where $\tau$ is in minutes \cite[]{Eagleson}.

Furthermore, I define a precipitation \textbf{non-event} $N_j^\tau$, as
having a contiguous set of zeros, $e_i=0$, whose combined duration exceeds
$\tau$, flanked left and right by non-zero values, $e_i=0$ \cite{Eagleson}.
% Basically we want the hand-drawn figure shown here!
One more term to define is \textbf{precipitation intensity}, which for a
precipitation event $E_j^\tau$ is the total amount of precipitation divided
by its duration, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  I_j^\tau = \fracd{\sum_i e_i }{d_j} ,
  \quad
  \mbox{for}\,\,\,\, i\,\,\,\, \mbox{belonging to the event}\,\,\,\, E_j^\tau
  .
\end{equation}

For further analysis, I am breaking down the year into seasons, as different
seasons may have different characteristics with regards to precipitation. I
will define the seasons as follows: Winter will be December, January, and
February. `Winter' of a certain year contains December of the previous
year. Spring will be March, April, and May. Summer is June, July, and
August. Fall is September, October, November.

These following histograms show the distribution of precipitation event
duration in terms of minutes and shows the different duration distributions
per season. For precipitation and non-precipitation events, $\tau = 1$~min,
which means we will be recording all precipitation events that are 1 minute
or longer in duration. This covers all potential precipitation events.

These histograms show that the smallest duration events for both
nonprecipitation and precipitation events are the most numerous as seen with
the largest bar in the bins that contain 1 minute to 2 minute durations. The
frequency of duration decreases as we increase the duration bins. At the
same time, there are differences between the precipitation and
non-precipitation events: the upper limit for duration of precipitation
events are about 300 to 400 minutes. However, the upper limit for duration
of non-precipitation events is about an order of magnitude greater at about
2000 minutes. Basically non-precipitation events can be as long as one or
two whole days, where as precipitation events can only last as long as 5-6
hours.

The intensity histogram shows an even stronger aggregation in the lowest
intensity bin of 1~mm/hour to 2~mm/hour. It is interesting because the small
intensity bin can include events that are long but less intense and short,
less intense precipitation events.

\section{Analysis of Precipitation}\label{sec:apc}

% FJS Here I do something. 

\subsection{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

Once we have characterized the climatology of precipitation, we will start
moving towards buidling predictive models for precipitation. In order to see
how accurate such models are in comparison to observed precipitation. Such
accuracy we shall use is to see whether the model and the observed data
match in terms of whether there exists precipitation at a given minute. We
ignore the non-precipitation when looking at accuracy because by matching
non-precipitation minutes in both the model and the observed data, we end up
getting an accuracy of over 90\%, which not useful. So, if the model and the
observed data do not match in terms whether there exists precipitation, this
contributes to the model being deemed less accurate. We can have a stricter
definition of accuracy, in which we set up the precipitation condition, in
addition to saying that the intensity must match too, otherwise we can not
say the model and observed data match. This stricter definition of model
accuracy might be used when thinking about

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:apcr}

Figure~\ref{p2019} shows the distribution of durations of 3198 precipitation
events $E_j^1$, i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=1$~min for the year 2019, broken
down by season. In order to make bins that contain non-zero values, I
created bins using duration percentiles. I used unique values obtained from
using a range of percentiles from 0 to 100, in 2 and 5 percent
intervals. For one analysis, I stopped at 98 \% believing this would be the
best approach in terms of fitting. At the same time, I also made sure to
analyze the data including the 100 percentile, to see how it differs when
including the extremes. Such purpose is also to realize that excluding such
extremes produced modelled precipitation that did not last long as well as
well as the gaps between precipitation events being too small.

I used an exponential fit to the frequency-duration histograms for all 1253
events $E_j^2$, i.e. $E_j^\tau$ where $\tau=2$~min. For all the other years,
as shown in Figures~\ref{p2020}, \ref{p2018} and~\ref{p2017}, I used a
similar procedure.

Excluding the first interval shown, focusing on events of duration
greater than or equal to 2~min, we propose an exponential model for
the histogram, with the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{expod}
  F = \beta \,e^{\alpha d},
\end{equation}
where $F$ is the frequency and $d$ the duration, and with $\beta$ the
unitless frequency coefficient and $\alpha$ is the exponential coefficient
(in units of min$^{-1}$). Table~\ref{firsttable} shows the
coefficients~$\beta$ and the exponential coefficients~$\alpha$ from looking
at the yearly frequency of precipitation duration.

We shall also propose the following equations which will also describe an
exponential model for the histogram regarding non-precipitation events,
which is described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{expod_np}
	F_{np} = \gamma \,e^{\delta D},
\end{equation}
where $F_{np}$ is the frequency of non-precipitation events, $D$ being
duration, and $\gamma $ being the unitless frequency coefficient and $\delta
$ is the exponential coefficient. Table~\ref{thirdtable_98} shows the
coefficients~$\gamma$ and exponential coefficients~$\delta$ from looking at
yearly frequency of non-precipitation event durations.

Another similar equation for precipitation intensity can be described by the
following equation:
\begin{equation}\label{expod_inten}
	F_{inten} = \epsilon \,e^{\zeta I},
\end{equation}
where $F_{inten}$ is the frequency of intensity of precipitation events, $I$
is the intensity of the precipitation events, $\epsilon$ is the unitless
frequency coefficient, and $\zeta$ is the exponential
coefficient. Table~\ref{fourthtable} shows the coefficients~$\epsilon$ and
the exponential coefficients~$\zeta$ from looking at yearly frequency of
intensity of precipitation events.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec:apcd}

\input{firsttable}

\input{firsttable_100}

Based on Table~\ref{firsttable}, the $\beta$ values are similar to each
other with the exception of 2017, which only had partial data starting in
the Summer. Even, with the partial data we have from 2017 and 2020, it is
clear that the $\alpha$ values are similar to each other. Focusing on the
years with complete data, 2018 and 2019, it is clear that yearly variations
exists between them. All $\alpha$ values are negative.

In the seasonal variations, we see that Summer has $\alpha$ values that are
less negative compared to the other seasons as well as having a lower
$\beta$ compared to the other seasons.  The Spring appears to mimic the
Winter in that there are a lot of preciptiation events, but also shares the
quality of Summer in having fairly high precipitation totals. The Fall
shares the Summer quality of having relatively few preciptation events, but
tends to have smaller precipitation totals, so its intensity is less than
the Summer, but greater than the winter precipitation intensity.

Compared to Table~\ref{firsttable}, Table~\ref{firsttable_100} seems to show
a $\beta$ value that are consistently lower when considering the 100th
percentile bins for precipitation event durations. The $\alpha$ values are
also less negative, which better reflects the fact there are these extreme
durations for precipitation events.
 
\input{thirdtable.tex}

\input{thirdtable_100.tex}

Looking at trying to extend the exponential fit towards non-precipitation
event durations, the exponentials for such duration, $\delta$ is less
negative overall compared to the exponentials from the precipitation event
duration, $\alpha$. Some of this is explained from the fact that the
duration of non-precipitation events range from 1 minute to over 2000
minutes, whereas the duration of precipitation events range from 1 minute to
just over 300 to 400 minutes. At the same time how we bin the durations for both
precipitation and non-precipitation events will affect how we get the fits.

Once again, taking into the account the most extreme durations for
non-precipitation events lowers the frequency value of $\gamma$ and the
exponential constant of $\delta$ is less negative, when comparing
Table~\ref{thirdtable_98} and Table~\ref{thirdtable_100}

\input{fourthtable.tex}
\input{fourthtable_100.tex}

In contrast, Table~\ref{fourthtable} for intensity of precipitation events
show a more negative exponential compared to either precipitation or
non-precipitation event durations. This is partially due to the fact that
there are less bins in the intensity of preciptiation events as seen that
the vast majority of precipitation events are not particularly intense on
average.

Looking at the different between Table~\ref{fourthtable} and
Table~\ref{fourthtable_100}, intensity clearly has the biggest changes from
using 98th percentile to the 100th percentile. First the $\epsilon$ value
actually increases when you use the 100th percentile rather than the 98th
percentile. Furthermore, we see that the $\zeta$ value also becomes less
negative , but very dramatically compared to non-precipitation and
precipitation event durations.

However looking at Table~\ref{secondtable}, we see that the summers also
have a lot of precipitation. The fewer amounts of precipitation events in
the Summer, but with a lot of precipitation gives a higher intensity for the
Summer. For the Winter, the $\alpha$ are the furthest from 0 and the $\beta$
are large. However, Winter tends to have the lowest values for total
precipitation and the combination of lots of preciptation events and low
precipitation totals results in the lowest intensities among the four
seasons.

\section{Simulation for Prediction}\label{sec:sfp}

\subsection{Method}\label{sec:sfp_m}

To make a base line model for us to look at, we need to first use the
exponentials that we calculated for the duration of the precipitation event,
intensity of the precipitation event, and duration of the non-precipitation
events. However, we also need to manually add back in the lowest durations
and lowest intensities, since we excluded those values when calculating the
exponential distributions. Since the frequencies are in the bins of values
that are distributed by percentiles, we make use of the fact that there is
an equal chance of pulling a value in the bin ranges. Thus once we have all
the probabilities in place for precipitation event duration,
non-precipitation event duration, and precipitation event intensity, we can
start running a simulation based on the values that come from the data that
we analyzed.

\subsection{Results}\label{sec:sfp_r}

\begin{figure}[t]

  \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/better_one_run.png}
  \caption[One run using Summer 2018 climatology]

  {\label{crudemodel}One model run using the exponentials calculated from Summer 2018.}
\end{figure}

Running the model one hundred times let us look at what the average
precipitation total the model yields, it yields 195 mm compared to the
Summer 2018 total of 268 mm that we used. Furthermore, the accuracy of model
precipitation matching model precipitation is only 6$\%$. Looking at
\ref{crudemodel}, we see that the model precipitation total is lower than
the actual precipitation observed in the Summer of 2018. Furthermore, the
precipitation seem to be more frequent compared to the observed 2018 Summer
data.

It is clear that despite the better fit using the curve fit of 98th
percentile, we need to use the 100th percentile, since the extremes such as
the big 2000 minute non-precipitation even is very important in the nature
of the precipitation event. However, it is clear that the accuracy does not
improve significantly. The fact that the model total precipitation is still
less than from the initial observed precipitation shows how this model needs
more improvement.
