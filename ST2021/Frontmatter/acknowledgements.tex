I would like to acknowledge my senior thesis advisor Frederik J. Simons for giving me constant feedback on my work as well as providing me with the data that he is collecting on top of Guyot Hall. His patience and guidance through this tough year was welcomed for sure. I also thank Professor Alan Rubin for being my second reader. 

I also like to acknowledge my family, who has been very supportive and understanding in my time in Princeton, especially during this past year. 

My Princeton friends who were also in the thesis grind who were also struggling over the past year. Our common struggle helped us bond in these rather tough times. 

Finally all those in the Geoscience department, especially my fellow seniors in which we tried to make the best out of a weird situation for our seniors.
