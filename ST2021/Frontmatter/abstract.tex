Princeton's climate is one that has four seasons and a high temperature variation through the year. The precipitation in Princeton is spread out throughout the year. Precipitation events are often characterized by an exponential distribution of both the duration and the total precipitation per event. The shortest precipitation events and the smallest precipitation totals are the most frequent, while the longer the precipitation event, the less likely it is to occur at any given point.  By analyzing the precipitation that is measured from Professor Simons' Vaisala weather station on the top of Guyot Hall from 2017 to present day, I can first summarize the data that is being characterized, then start using this climatology to start predicting precipitation events based on other variables that are observed in the weather station.
